Various studies on C and C++ that I prepared in 2019-20 are included here. With these studies, voluntary and private lessons were given to two different groups of university students. These students were studying in electronics and computer engineering departments.

In addition, these documents have been prepared to assist university students at various levels in their relevant courses. Beginner-level resources have been scanned, presentations have been prepared in a format that can also appeal to intermediate and advanced levels, and sample solutions have been included..

It was shared online and face to face with different students, especially during the pandemic period. The contents were presented and the prepared problems were solved. Advanced applications were carried out by including students in project-like studies.


It is intended as a reference for those interested. The majority of the included samples have been run. Examples and solutions at the project work level are also available. All files required to run projects are also located in the folders.


I hope it will be useful to those interested...
